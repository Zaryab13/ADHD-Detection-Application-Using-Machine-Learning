# ADHD Detection Application using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Introduction

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting millions of people around the world. Providing immediate intervention and assistance is critical when this condition is diagnosed early and accurately.

Deep learning and machine learning are potential approaches for enhancing the detection of ADHD disease. This project aims to create a user-friendly application that utilizes Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to detect ADHD and provide rapid results based on EEG signals and MRI scans.

## Problem Statement

As the worldwide prevalence rate of ADHD for school-age children is approximately 5%, Approximately 60% of preteens continue to suffer from symptoms into adulthood ADHD is characterized by developmentally inappropriate inattention, motor overactivity, and impulsiveness [1].

Normally when an EEG (electroencephalogram) or MRI test is done, the data is analyzed by a neurologist, and the results are finalized after 48 hours. Sometimes it takes several days for a patient to receive their results. Also, there is no platform (website/application) where users can submit their EEG/MRI data and get quick results. Using the Deep Learning technique CNN, the goal is to address these problems by reducing the time required for analyzing EEG signals and MRI reports to predict ADHD disease while achieving the highest accuracy of results and making a user-friendly platform where users can get instant results. This innovation benefits neurologists by providing them with more timely insights from EEG/MRI data and caters to the need for an accessible platform for locals to submit their data and receive results.
